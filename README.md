# My-Adventitious-Projects
This repository contains reports of some of the casual projects I have done as my class projects or while exploring new things.

These projects may seem fruitless as an individual project, but each one of them taught me something I didn't knew before. These projects are very valuable for a versetile development of my carrer.
